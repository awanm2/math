# Notes
Let's say we have following two equations

```math
\begin{array}{lcl} 
    2x -y & = & 0 \\ 
    -z 2y & = & 3\end{array}
```
Now this can be written as a matrix 
```math 
    \begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1 \\ 
                    -1 & 2 
    \end{bmatrix} 
    
    \left[ 
    \begin{array}{c} x \\ y \end{array} 
    \right] 
    =
    \left[ \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 3 \end{array} 
    \right]
```
